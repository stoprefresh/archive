The stockDb.sql script will create a database named "stockdb", and a user with DML privileges on it.

The createStockTable.sql script will create a table named "symbol" and load it with data from "stocks.tsv".

1. Use mysql as "root" to run the stockDb.sql script first.

   mysql -u root -p < stockDb.sql

2. Use mysql as "root" to run createStockTable.sql.

   mysql -u root -p < createStockTable.sql
